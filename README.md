This repository contains worked examples from class for the R lab. Each script goes through the weekly lab topic with examples of how do things. This will be updated after each class.

And yes, I should probably not have a `data_examples` and `example_data` repository. The first is for example data that we use specifically in the lab, while the latter contains the RData files that are used in the textbooks more broadly.
