* How to replicate analysis:

1. Open "ds-analysis.do" and change "SET PATH HERE" to the file pathway where replication files are saved
2. Open "ucdp-analysis.do" and change "SET PATH HERE" to the file pathway where replication files are saved
3. Run "ds-analysis.do" and "ucdp-analysis.do" in Stata to replicate analysis in paper and Web Appendix

* How to replicate fragmentation coding:

1. Open "ds-fragmentation-coding.do" and change "SET PATH HERE" to the file pathway where replication files are saved
2. Open "ucdp-datasetup.do" and change "SET PATH HERE" to the file pathway where replication files are saved
3. Run "ds-fragmentation-coding.do" and "ucdp-datasetup.do" in Stata to replicate data used in analysis in paper and Web Appendix

* Questions

If you have any questions about the replication materials, please contact Peter Rudloff at peter.rudloff@okstate.edu or Michael Findley at mikefindley@utexas.edu
